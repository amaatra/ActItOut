    <h3>Creating an empowering learning environment for underprivileged children while teaching them to express
        themselves through theatre and further develop their skills (specifically their English speaking skills).</h3>

            <h2 class="center" id="OurMission">Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to create a safe and inclusive space where children can learn the skills they need to succeed,
                both on and off the stage. We believe that theatre is a powerful way for children to develop their English
                speaking skills, while also learning valuable life skills, like self-discipline, teamwork, and empathy. With
                experienced instructors and a variety of programs designed for different skill levels, we are dedicated to
                providing theatre that are accessible to everyone.</p>

        <h2 class="center" id="AboutUs">About Us</h2>
        <p>For us, it has always been about making a difference. We recognized the value of a quality education from an
            early age, and were able to see how the performing arts could help bring that message to life for others. By
            starting Act It Out we have created a platform to share our passion with our community, and to help educate
            young people about the importance of education and creativity. We provide online workshops that combine the
            best of both theatre and quality education.</p>
