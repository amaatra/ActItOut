    <h2 class="p-3 mb-2 text-secondary text-center">Outlining The Problem</h2>

    <p style="margin:0 20%" class="lead">Education unlocks a profound potential within individuals and societies alike. It liberates
        intellect, ignites imaginations, and fosters a fundamental sense of self-worth. Education opens up many
        opportunities for individuals and empowers them. Recognising the benefits of education we must strive to ensure
        that it is accessible to all. (The Global Goals). So what exactly is the problem? Let's break it down into 3
        parts.</p>

    <div class="container mw-100 mission bg-white" id="mission">
        <div class="row align-items-center">
            <div class="col">
                <h4 class="text-center">Teaching Methods</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">Teachers in government schools often have limited resources and support. They
                    may not have enough
                    time to properly explain topics to students, and they may not have access to the materials they need
                    to create engaging lessons. Clearly, we can see that the education that is provided to them at
                    school can also be done at home. They can simply look at a textbook themselves at home however
                    teachers are supposed to guide them, help them with questions and actually explain the topic to them
                    instead of just reading it. We spoke to (Jyoti Durge) an english teacher at a government school. She
                    told us that teachers also realise the problem but they can't do much about it because each class
                    has 45-60 students so it's very difficult to ensure everyone has understood and the limited time
                    makes it hard for teachers to explain topics.
                    She also said that having 60 students also means it is very hard to control the class and just to
                    get people to pay attention and not talk takes about 10-15 minutes. These challenges can have a
                    negative impact on students' learning and development. It is also very hard for students to find
                    time at home to work since they usually need to get water, and clean the house.. once they get home.
                    Most of them also walk to school and back and it is a long way to travel</p>

            <div class="col">
                <h4 class="text-center">Lack of English Fluency</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">Due to this, students are not able to speak in english fluently. Additionally,
                    they only have one
                    English class per day, and the rest of the day they speak Hindi or their local language.There are a
                    few english medium government schools also but they are very less. Overall in India 42% of students
                    study in hindi medium schools, 26% in english and 6% in Bengali and the remaining is in other local
                    languadge. ("UDISE+ Report: More than 42% Children Study in Hindi, over 26% in English") This
                    clearly emphasises the problem considering the fact that most students go to hindi medium schools
                    and even in the english medium government schools we find that a lot of the students find it
                    difficult to speak in english which is even worse considering it is the language of instruction for
                    other subjects as well.</p>
                <img style="height:300px; width:auto; margin-left:25%" src="Jyoti Durge.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <h4 class="text-center">Lack of opportunities</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">Students who are not fluent in English may struggle to keep up in class and may
                    not be able to participate fully in discussions or activities. They may also score less in exams,
                    which can limit their opportunities for college and future careers. There are certain students who
                    are good at maths and science, but even in subjects they are good at, they score less because the
                    exams are in english. While Hindi is the national language in India, English is the official
                    language.
                    This means not being fluent in english closes a lot of opportunities for students. Most entrance
                    exams for colleges are in english and most jobs require you to know english. In Order to live a
                    better lifestyle and work in a well paying job one needs to know english.
                    The last problem is that many students in government schools come from low-income families, facing
                    financial insecurity and challenges meeting basic needs. This constant pressure can be a significant
                    source of stress.Additionally, the stress and frustration because of the language barrier simply
                    aggrevates this. Both of us (Royna and Sharaanya) go to a private school. We get the opportunity to
                    pursue things outside of school, like drama, music and art, which is a creative way for us to
                    express ourselves and also helps with stress and anxiety. (WHO) In government schools art or music
                    is usually a short class with students till about 5th grade, but they don't get to take it in higher
                    grades when it could benefit them more with their stress and anxiety.</p>
