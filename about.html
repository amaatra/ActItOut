                    <h4>Sharaanya:</h2>
                        <p>In 5th grade we had a PYPX in school in which we had to pick an SDG and then research and
                            spread
                            awareness about the same. In the end we had an exhibition in which we showed students from
                            lower
                            grades, teachers and parents what we learnt and created. I remember wanting to choose the
                            SDG of
                            gender inequality but my teacher told me I had to go with Quality education as there were
                            not
                            many people working on that goal and there were too many working on gender discrimination. I
                            remember being quite disheartened as I wanted to work with my friends and I did not even
                            understand what Quality education meant. I had to work with 3 other students on this goal
                            and
                            somewhere along the process once I had understood what quality education was I started to
                            realise the importance of it. I realised that if we can simply provide quality education to
                            everyone it could help with other SDG goals as well. The PYPX journey stuck with me. In 7th
                            grade I wanted to make a direct initiative to help people learn. That was when I discovered
                            Aasha Foundation. Aasha had adults who needed help with phonics in order to read. While all
                            of
                            them knew english they could not read it hindering their ability to get better jobs. I
                            taught
                            the same student for about a year and she would tell me about her daughter and how she loved
                            theatre but she doesn't have the money to learn. I have been teaching at Aasha for 3 and a
                            half
                            years now and I aim to continue it alongside my NGO. Combining this knowledge, my love for
                            theatre, and the understanding that it is very hard for children to get jobs and educate
                            themselves without knowing english I approached my friend Royna. She also loves theatre and
                            she
                            loves children. At the beginning of this academic year Royna and I decided to act upon our
                            ideas
                            and start an NGO. </p>

                    <h4>Royna:</h2>
                        <p>Ever since I was in primary, I have been participating in school musicals, whether it be
                            acting or being a part of backstage crew. Since childhood, I have been surrounded by plays,
                            musicals, and films. All the adults in my family work in the field of filmmaking, so many
                            aspects of the performing arts have always been prominent in my life. My experience with
                            theatre has always been great, it made me gain a sense of community, and learn what it means
                            to be in a team, I’ve always associated theatre with good. I am also someone who absolutely
                            loves children. So when Mr Amin Sheikh the founder of Bombay To Barcelona Library cafe had
                            come to our school as a guest speaker, he spoke about what underprivileged children face on
                            a daily basis. I am a strong believer that children never choose to be born we bring them
                            into the world but yet so many children don’t get basic necessities education being one of
                            them. All children deserve an equal opportunity to education and to express themselves. This
                            is why I decided to join Sharaanya and work on what both of us believe in. </p>
